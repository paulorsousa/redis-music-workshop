# Redis Music Workshop

> A 2-hour, hands-on workshop to introduce Redis

## Context

You work at a music-streaming company. The product has a **React web front-end** backed by a **Python REST API** (FastAPI) that uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary database for songs and artists.

Everything works — until it doesn't. As the platform grows, several parts of the system start showing performance, correctness, and scalability problems.
In each module you will **observe a concrete problem**, then **fix it with the right Redis data structure**.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:

### Docker & Docker Compose

Docker is used to run all workshop services (Redis, PostgreSQL, API, and Frontend) in containers.

- **Docker Desktop** (includes Docker Engine + Docker Compose):
  - [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
  - [Install Docker Desktop on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)

- **Docker Engine only** (Linux / WSL — if not using Docker Desktop):
  - [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - [Post-installation steps (manage Docker as a non-root user)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

- **Docker Compose** (standalone — only needed if Docker Compose is not bundled with your Docker installation):
  - [Install Docker Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Verify your installation:

```bash
docker --version            # e.g. Docker version 28.x
docker compose version      # e.g. Docker Compose version v2.x
```

### Python 3

Python 3 is required to run the `./workshop` CLI tool (it uses only the standard library — no pip packages needed).

- [Download Python 3 (official)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Mac** (via Homebrew): `brew install python`
- **Ubuntu / Debian / WSL**: `sudo apt install python3`
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install python3`

Verify your installation:

```bash
python3 --version           # e.g. Python 3.13.x
```

## CLI utility — `workshop`

A Python CLI tool (`workshop`) ships with the repo. It wraps every simulation, data-loading, and verification step so students don't waste time writing boilerplate. It is implemented with `argparse` and uses the same RESTful API / Redis / PostgreSQL connections as the application.

The `--user` flag accepts a **username** (e.g. `user-1`) and derives the 36-char UUID internally, matching the frontend behaviour.

```
./workshop <command> [options]
```

### Commands

## Module 1 — Caching & TTL

**⏱ 20 min**

### Problem

The platform generates **daily mixes** for every user. The algorithm is slow: for each request it loops over all songs, scoring each one before returning the top 50.

> [!NOTE]
> _Simulated in code with a `time.sleep(5)` inside the generation function. Keep it to simulate a real-world expensive computation._

Calling the endpoint twice for the same user runs the expensive algorithm twice.

### Observe

```bash
./workshop daily-mix --user user-1          # ~5 s
./workshop daily-mix --user user-1          # ~5 s again — no caching
```

### Goal

Use Redis as a **cache** so the computation runs once and subsequent requests are instant.

### Key Redis commands

| Command                    | Purpose                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `SET key value EX seconds` | Store the result with an automatic expiry |
| `GET key`                  | Retrieve the cached result                |
| `TTL key`                  | Check remaining time-to-live              |
| `DEL key`                  | Manually invalidate                       |

### Steps

1. Open `api/services/daily_mix.py`.
2. Before the slow computation, check Redis: `GET daily-mix:{user_id}`. If found, return it.
3. After computing, store: `SET daily-mix:{user_id} <json> EX 86400`.
4. Verify:

```bash
./workshop daily-mix --user user-1          # ~5 s (cold)
./workshop daily-mix --user user-1          # < 10 ms (cached)
```

### Discussion

- What happens after 24 h?
- How would the user force a refresh? (`DEL`)
- What are the risks of caching? (stale data, cold starts, thundering herd)

---

## Module 2 — Atomic Counters

**⏱ 15 min**

### Problem

Every play event increments a counter in PostgreSQL using `SELECT` → add 1 → `UPDATE`.
Under concurrency, two requests can read the same value and both write `count + 1` — **losing an increment**!

### Observe

```bash
./workshop simulate-plays --song song-1 --concurrent
# Expected: 100 — Actual: less than 100 (lost updates)
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `--concurrent` to fire requests in parallel — without it, requests run sequentially and the race condition won't manifest.

### Goal

Implement song play counts with Redis **atomic counters**.

### Key Redis commands

| Command    | Purpose                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| `INCR key` | Atomically increment by 1 |
| `GET key`  | Read the current count    |

### Steps

1. Open `api/services/songs.py` — find the `play_song` function.
2. Replace the SELECT/UPDATE with `INCR play-count:song:{song_id}`.
3. Verify:

```bash
./workshop simulate-plays --song song-1 --count 500 --concurrent
# Now: exactly 500 added
```

### Discussion

- How / when do you sync back to PostgreSQL?
- What happens if Redis restarts? (persistence: RDB / AOF)

> [!WARNING]
> By moving play counts to Redis, the **Top Songs** leaderboard (which still reads from PostgreSQL) is now broken — it will always show zero plays. We'll fix this right away in the next module.

---

## Module 3 — Sorted Sets

**⏱ 15 min**

### Problem

The leaderboard on the home page shows the **"Top Songs"** by play count. It queries PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM songs ORDER BY play_count DESC LIMIT 50;
```

After Module 2 moved play counts to Redis, this query returns stale data — PostgreSQL's `play_count` column is no longer updated.

### Goal

We need a data structure that:

1. **Associates each song with a numeric score** (its play count).
2. **Keeps members sorted by score** at all times — no need to re-sort on every read.
3. **Updates scores atomically** — concurrent play events never lose an increment.

A Redis **Sorted Set** does exactly this. Every member has a floating-point score, and Redis keeps them sorted automatically. Inserts, score updates, and range queries are all **O(log N)**.

Replace the counter from Module 2 with a Sorted Set — `ZINCRBY` is also atomic, so it serves as both the counter and the ranking. Use `ZSCORE` wherever you need to read a single song's play count.

> [!NOTE]
> ZSCORE is O(1) — it's a hash lookup under the hood.

### Key Redis commands

| Command                        | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `ZINCRBY key increment member` | Atomically add to a member's score |
| `ZREVRANGE key 0 N WITHSCORES` | Top N members by score             |
| `ZREVRANK key member`          | "What position is this song?"      |
| `ZSCORE key member`            | "How many plays?"                  |

### Steps

1. Open `api/services/songs.py` — in `play_song`, replace the `INCR` with `ZINCRBY top-songs 1 {song_id}`.
2. In `get_song` (same file), replace `GET play-count:song:{song_id}` with `ZSCORE top-songs {song_id}` to read a single song's play count.
3. Open `api/services/leaderboard.py` — use `ZREVRANGE top-songs 0 {per_page-1} WITHSCORES` to get the top song IDs and scores, then fetch the song details (title, artist, genre) from PostgreSQL. Redis gives you the ranking; PostgreSQL complements it with the metadata.
4. Verify:

```bash
./workshop reset
./workshop simulate-plays --song song-1 --count 20 --concurrent
./workshop simulate-plays --song song-2 --count 35 --concurrent
./workshop top-songs
# song-2: 35, song-1: 20
```

### Discussion

- How would you build a "trending this week" chart? (time-windowed key + `EXPIRE`)
- What if we want to show the top songs of all time, but also the top songs of the last week/month/year? (multiple sorted sets, `ZUNION`/`ZINTER` for combined views)

---

## Module 4 — Sets

**⏱ 15 min**

### Problem

The platform tracks **monthly distinct listeners** per artist. The current implementation uses a Redis **List**: before appending a user ID, it scans the list to check for duplicates — **O(N) per event**.

### Observe

```bash
./workshop reset
./workshop add-listeners --artist artist-1 --count 5000     # note the time (~10 s)
./workshop add-listeners --artist artist-1 --count 5000     # same operation, but slower (~15 s) — List now has 10K entries, O(N) check on every insert
```

### Goal

Use a Redis **Set** for **O(1)** add-with-dedup.

### Key Redis commands

| Command                | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `SADD key member`      | Add; ignores duplicates                 |
| `SCARD key`            | Count distinct members                  |
| `SISMEMBER key member` | Check membership in O(1)                |
| `SINTER key1 key2`     | Listeners in common between two artists |

### Steps

1. Open `api/services/artists.py` — find the `add_listener` function.
2. Replace the List + scan with `SADD monthly-listeners:{artist_id}:{YYYY-MM} {user_id}`.
3. Replace the `LLEN` with `SCARD` on `_get_listener_count` function as well.
4. Verify:

```bash
./workshop reset
./workshop add-listeners --artist artist-1 --count 5000
./workshop add-listeners --artist artist-1 --count 5000
# Constant speed regardless of size (~5s)
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Redis needs to be reset, because the key we're using for the Set is the same as the one used for the List in the previous module.
> Otherwise, we'll get an "WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value" error.

### Discussion

- Why are we using YYYY-MM as part of the key? (monthly aggregation)
- Sets store each member in full — what about memory at 100M scale? (→ Module 5)

---

## Module 5 — HyperLogLog

**⏱ 15 min**

### Problem

Module 4 improved speed, but **not memory** usage. Each user ID is stored in full in the Set.
Our top-5 artists count with ~100 M monthly listeners (36-char UUIDs each):

```
100 000 000 × 36 bytes ≈ 3.4 GiB per artist
5 artists ≈ 17 GiB — just for 5 artists
```

### Goal

Use **HyperLogLog**: approximates distinct count in ~12 KB of memory, regardless of cardinality.
It's a probabilistic data structure, so the count is approximate, but the error is small (0.81 % standard error).

### Key Redis commands

| Command                  | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PFADD key element`      | Observe an element                                 |
| `PFCOUNT key`            | Approximate distinct count (0.81 % standard error) |
| `PFMERGE dest src1 src2` | Merge HLLs (e.g. weekly → monthly)                 |

### Observe

```bash
./workshop reset
./workshop add-listeners --artist artist-1 --count 10000
./workshop get-redis-memory-usage
# Set: 817 KiB
# HLL: ...
```

### Steps

1. Open `api/services/artists.py`.
2. Replace `SADD` with `PFADD hll-listeners:{artist_id}:{YYYY-MM} {user_id}` in `add_listener` function.
3. Replace the `SCARD` count with `PFCOUNT` in `_get_listener_count` function.
4. Re-run the listener ingestion and compare memory using `./workshop get-redis-memory-usage`.

### Compare

- **Set**: ~817 KiB (10K listeners)
- **HLL**: ~14.1 KiB (9.9K listeners: ~0.1 % error; ~58x less memory)

> [!NOTE]
> Contrary to Sets, HLL memory usage is **not** affected by the number of distinct elements.

### Discussion

- HLL is **probabilistic** — you cannot list members or check membership.
- When is ~1 % error acceptable? When isn't it?

---

## Module 6 — VectorSets _(bonus — if time allows)_

**⏱ 20 min**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module requires additional dependencies (`sentence-transformers`, `numpy`).
> To keep the initial setup lightweight, all VectorSet code lives on a dedicated branch.
>
> ```bash
> git checkout vectorsets
> ```
>
> Then rebuild the containers so the extra dependencies are installed:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose up --build
> ```

### Problem

The product team wants a **"Similar Songs"** section. Traditional tag-based matching is too coarse.

### Goal

Use Redis **VectorSets** (Redis 8.0+) to store song embeddings and perform similarity search.

### Pre-requisites

- Checkout the `vectorsets` branch (see above).
- Song data in `data/songs.csv` (already used to seed PostgreSQL).
- The API container has `sentence-transformers` installed and computes embeddings when triggered via `POST /admin/load-embeddings`.
- Redis 8.0+ (included in the Docker Compose setup).

### Key Redis commands

| Command                                               | Purpose                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `VADD key [REDUCE dim] FP32 element VALUES v1 v2 ...` | Store an embedding           |
| `VSIM key ELE element COUNT N`                        | Find N most similar elements |

### Steps

1. Load the embeddings:

```bash
./workshop load-embeddings
# 500 song embeddings loaded (384 dimensions)
```

2. Query:

- Open `api/services/songs.py` — find the `find_similar_songs` function.
- Check the call to `VSIM song-vectors ELE {song_id} COUNT {count}`.
- Verify:

```bash
./workshop similar-songs --song song-42 --count 5
# 1. song-108  (score: 0.94)
# 2. song-271  (score: 0.91)
# ...
```

3. Wire `GET /songs/{id}/similar` to `VSIM song-vectors ELE {song_id} COUNT 10`.

### Discussion

- How do you update embeddings when metadata changes?
- Trade-offs vs a dedicated vector database?

---

## Cleanup

```bash
./workshop destroy [--rmi all] [--prune-build-cache]
```

## Summary

| Module | Data structure    | Problem                                   | Time             |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1      | Strings + TTL     | Redundant expensive computation           | 20 min           |
| 2      | Counters (`INCR`) | Lost updates under concurrency            | 15 min           |
| 3      | Sorted Sets       | Real-time leaderboards                    | 15 min           |
| 4      | Sets              | O(N) deduplication                        | 15 min           |
| 5      | HyperLogLog       | Memory explosion for cardinality counting | 15 min           |
| 6      | VectorSets        | Semantic similarity search                | 20 min _(bonus)_ |

Each module builds on the same application. By the end, students have seen how Redis **complements** a relational database — not as a replacement, but as the right tool for specific problems.
